<h3> 13 Reasons Why.</h3>
	
<p>First and foremost I thought about was Forbes website. I often visit it to read the mindset of top figures in the world and I also stalk my fav celebrities financial side. I would recommend this website to my friends to help them gain knowledge. Overall it's a good website to visit and that is the primary thought process that went through my head.</p>

<p>I like websites that help you play games on as smooth as your phone. And Miniclip website was the first to cross my mind for many reasons. Firstly that it is very well made. Second that it has interesting games and run smoothly. Finally it has my favourite game 8 ball pool which is a great way to pass time.</p>

<p>I love love love watching movies and series to kill time and gain perspective on things. Netflix is undoubtedly the top streaming website out there probably followed by prime video. These websites are very user friendly and have tons of content to be viewed. They suggest content to watch based on your last watched thing and it really helps to explore.</p>

<p>Finally I suggested tools like quillbot and phind because they have been a major help for me to clear my semester. Their website is easy to use and gets the required work done super quickly. </p>
