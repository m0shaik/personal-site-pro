		"overview" : "Working through Exercises for Programmers was like a coding bootcamp I could dive into anytime, anywhere. Each challenge in the book focuses on practical tasksâ€”things like calculating loan payments, creating simple calculators, or tracking sales figures. These exercises gave me the chance to dig into real-world coding scenarios where I could implement logic, refactor, and improve as I went along. I approached each problem by first planning a basic structure, coding a rough solution, and then iterating to make it cleaner and more efficient."
